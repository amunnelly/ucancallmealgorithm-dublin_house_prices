    "# Dublin House Prices by Post Code\n",
    "## Part 1 - Sourcing and Cleaning the Data\n",
    "Certain details on the sales of property in Ireland going back to 2010 are available for download here, on the Property Price Register website: https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en\n",
    "\n",
    "The website makes it clear that the Register is not a “Property Price Index,” as such; rather it is a record of submissions made to the Revenue Commissions for stamp duty purposes as part of the house conveyance process. Like that well-remembered man, Oliver Cromwell, the data is presented as it was filed, warts and all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to break down Dublin property prices in 2016 by time and post code. Let's see how far we can get with that using the **Property Price Register** data."

We use the `check_geometry` method to see if the latitude and longitude coordinates returned are reasonable ones for Dublin, by checking them against reasonably generous cardinal coordinates for north, south, east and west of the city. If we don't check this, we can get address in Dublin, Ohio or in New Zealand and other far-flung places. Not helpful.\n",
